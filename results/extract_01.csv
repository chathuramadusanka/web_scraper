      In this paper, we discuss biological effects of electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds in the context of cancer biology. In particular, we review the nanomechanical properties of microtubules (MTs), the latter being one of the most successful targets for cancer therapy. We propose an investigation on the coupling of electromagnetic radiation to mechanical vibrations of MTs as an important basis for biological and medical applications. In our opinion, optomechanical methods can accurately monitor and control the mechanical properties of isolated MTs in a liquid environment. Consequently, studying nanomechanical properties of MTs may give useful information for future applications to diagnostic and therapeutic technologies involving non-invasive externally applied physical ﬁelds. For example, electromagnetic ﬁelds or high intensity ultrasound can be used therapeutically avoiding harmful side effects of chemotherapeutic agents or classical radiation therapy.

      Nanobiosensors have played a key role as portable devices in the rapid breast cancer diagnosis and in clinical medicine like point-of-care devices. However, understanding biomarkers and nanomaterials is crucial for improving the performance of nanobiosensors for all stages of different diseases or treatment. Therefore, this study not only investigates the effect of biomarkers and nanomaterials such as metallic, carbon structures and quantum dot on the accuracy of nanobiosensors for early detection of breast cancer, but also exhibits how they are used in vivo and in vitro and their application in point-of-care devices for personalized cancer diagnosis. Afterwards, application of fluidics and microchips as point-of-care nanobiosensors in the early detection of biomarkers associated with breast cancer diagnosis was discussed. Furthermore, the integration of nanobiosensors in nanomotors platforms for the treatment of breast cancer was overviewed. Finally, the ongoing challenges and future trends on the detection limit of nanobiosensors, their application in point-of-care clinical diagnostics and the approaches implemented for their improvements by highlighting the successful reports on the revolution of personalized diagnostics were surveyed.

      This paper contains the review of quantum entanglement investigations in living systems, and in the quantum mechanically modelled photoactive prebiotic kernel systems. We define our modelled self-assembled supramolecular photoactive centres, composed of one or more sensitizer molecules, precursors of fatty acids and a number of water molecules, as a photoactive prebiotic kernel systems. We propose that life first emerged in the form of such minimal photoactive prebiotic kernel systems and later in the process of evolution these photoactive prebiotic kernel systems would have produced fatty acids and covered themselves with fatty acid envelopes to become the minimal cells of the Fatty Acid World. Specifically, we model self-assembling of photoactive prebiotic systems with observed quantum entanglement phenomena. We address the idea that quantum entanglement was important in the first stages of origins of life and evolution of the biospheres because simultaneously excite two prebiotic kernels in the system by appearance of two additional quantum entangled excited states, leading to faster growth and self-replication of minimal living cells. The quantum mechanically modelled possibility of synthesizing artificial self-reproducing quantum entangled prebiotic kernel systems and minimal cells also impacts the possibility of the most probable path of emergence of protocells on the Earth or elsewhere. We also examine the quantum entangled logic gates discovered in the modelled systems composed of two prebiotic kernels. Such logic gates may have application in the destruction of cancer cells or becoming building blocks of new forms of artificial cells including magnetically active ones.

      Graphene has distinctive mechanical, electronic, and optical properties, which researchers have applied to develop innovative electronic materials including transparent conductors and ultrafast transistors. Lately, the understanding of various chemical properties of graphene has expedited its application in high-performance devices that generate and store energy. Graphene is now increasing its terrain outside electronic and chemical applications toward biomedical areas such as precise bio sensing through graphene-quenched fluorescence, graphene-enhanced cell differentiation and growth, and graphene-assisted laser desorption/ionization for mass spectrometry. In this Account, we evaluate recent efforts to apply graphene and graphene oxides (GO) to biomedical research and a few different approaches to prepare graphene materials designed for biomedical applications and a brief perspective on their future applications. Because of its outstanding aqueous processability, amphiphilicity, surface functionalizability, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and fluorescence quenching ability, GO chemically exfoliated from oxidized graphite is considered a promising material for biological applications. In addition, the hydrophobicity and flexibility of large-area graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allow this material to play an important role in cell growth and differentiation. Graphene is considered to be an encouraging and smart candidate for numerous biomedical applications such as NIR-responsive cancer therapy and fluorescence bio-imaging and drug delivery. To that end, suitable preparation and unique approaches to utilize graphene-based materials such as graphene oxides (GOs), reduced graphene oxides (rGOs), and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in biology and medical science are gaining growing interest.

      MicroRNA (MiRNA) plays a crucial role in biological cells to enable assessment of a cancer's development stage. Increasing evidence has shown that the accurate and sensitive detection of miRNA holds the key toward correct disease diagnosis. However, some characteristics of miRNAs, such as their short chains, low concentration, and similar sequences, make it difficult to detect miRNA in biological samples. Nanomaterials usually have good optical, electronic, and mechanical properties and therefore provide new possibilities for improving the performance of miRNA assays. Many different sorts of nanomaterials, including metal nanomaterials, carbon nanomaterials, quantum dots, and transition-metal dichalcogenides, have been used to construct optical and electrochemical assays for miRNA and have shown attractive results. This review describes recent efforts in the application of nanomaterials as sensing elements in electrochemical and optical miRNA assays. The analytical figures of merit of various methods for the detection of miRNA are compared in the present article. The current capabilities, limitations, and future challenges in miRNA detection and analysis based on nanomaterials are also addressed.

      A novel strategy to precisely detect or monitor various biomaterials in living cells poses paramount importance in understanding cellular processes. Graphene, a newly emerged two-dimensional carbon material, has been widely utilized for biosensors owing to its multifarious characteristics including mechanical, electrical, and optical properties (e.g. stability, conductivity, fluorescence quenching and photoluminescence). In addition, graphene derivatives and their innate characteristics, such as biocompatibility low cytotoxicity and water solubility have facilitated the use of graphene-based materials for live cell biosensing, wherein graphene is utilized as a core material by itself or in combination with other functional nanomaterials to load target-specific probes, fluorescent dyes, and other signaling molecules. Such graphene-based hybrid nanomaterials have been employed to detect various cellular entities in living cells, including ions, biomolecules, genetic molecules, proteins, enzymes, and even whole cells. The following review will discuss a number of previous studies in which graphene-based hybrid constructs were used for live cell biosensing, and their potential applications in cancer research and stem cell therapy.

      Nanoparticles (NPs) have enormous potential to improve disease diagnosis and treatment due to their intrinsic electronic, optical, magnetic, mechanical, and physiological properties. To realize their full potential for nanomedicine, NPs must be biocompatible and targetable toward specific biomolecules to ensure selective sensing, imaging, and drug delivery in complex environments such as living cells, tissues, animals, and human bodies. In this Account, we summarize our efforts to impart specific biocompatibility and biorecognition functionality to NPs by developing strategies to integrate inorganic and organic NPs with functional DNA (fDNA), including aptamers, DNAzymes, and aptazymes to create fDNA-NPs. These hybrid NPs take advantage of fDNA's ability to either bind targets or catalyze reactions in the presence of targets selectively and utilize their unique physicochemical properties including small size, low immunogenicity, and ease of synthesis and chemical modification in comparison with other molecules such as antibodies. By integrating inorganic NPs such as gold NPs, quantum dots, and iron oxide nanoparticles with fDNA, we designed stimuli-responsive fDNA-NPs that exhibit target induced assembly and disassembly of NPs, resulting in a variety of colorimetric, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based sensors for diagnostic of a broad range of analytes. To impart both biocompatibility and selectivity on inorganic NPs for targeted bioimaging, we have demonstrated DNA-mediated surface functionalization, shape-controlled synthesis, and coordinative assembly of such NPs as specific bioprobes. A highlight is provided on the construction of fDNA-based nanoprobes with light-activatable sensing and imaging functions, which provides precise control of recognition properties of fDNA with high spatiotemporal resolution. To explore the potential of organic NPs for biosensing applications, we have developed an enzyme-responsive fDNA-liposome as a universal sensing platform compatible with diverse biological targets as well as different detection methods including fluorescence, MRI, or temperature, making possible point-of-care diagnostics. To expand the application regime of organic NPs, we collaborated with the Zimmerman group to prepare single-chain block copolymer-based NPs and incorporated it with a variety of functions, including monovalent DNA for assembly, tunable surface chemistry for cellular imaging, and coordinative Cu(II) sites for catalyzing intracellular click reactions, demonstrating the potential of using organic NPs to create promising fDNA-NP systems with programmable functionalities. Furthermore, we survey our recent endeavor in integration of cell-specific aptamers with different NPs for targeted drug delivery, showing that introducing stimuli-responsive properties into NPs that target tumor microenvironments would enable safer and more effective therapy for cancers. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives in fDNA-mediated engineering of NPs for biomedical applications are discussed.

      With the wide applications of magnetic fields (MFs) in medicine, researchers from different disciplines have gained interest in understanding the effect of various types of MFs on living cells and organisms. In this paper, we mainly focus on the immunological and physical aspects of the immune responses and their mechanisms under different types of MFs. Immune cells were slightly affected by low-frequency alternating MFs but were strongly influenced by moderate-intensity MFs and high-gradient MFs (HGMFs). Larger immune cells, such as macrophages, were more sensitive to HGMFs, which biased the cell polarization into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Subject to the gradient forces of varying directions and strength, the elongated M2 macrophage also remodeled the cytoskeleton with actin polymerization and changed the membrane receptors and ion channel gating. These alterations were very similar to changes caused by the small GTPase RhoA interference in macrophage. Regulation of iron metabolism may also contribute to the MF effects in macrophages. High MFs were found to regulate the iron content in monocyte-/macrophage-derived osteoclasts by affecting the expression of iron-regulation genes. On the other hand, paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) combined with external MFs play an important role in T-cell immunity. Paramagnetic NP-coated T-cells can cluster their T-cell receptors (TCRs) by using an external MF, thus increasing the cell-cell contact and communication followed by enhanced tumor killing capacity. The external MF can also guide the adoptively transferred magnetic NP-coated T-cells to their target sites in vivo, thus dramatically increasing the efficiency of cell therapy. Additionally, iron oxide NPs for ferroptosis-based cancer therapy and other MF-related therapeutic applications with obstacles were also addressed. Furthermore, for a profound understanding of the effect of MFs on immune cells, multidisciplinary research involving both experimental research and theoretical modeling is essential.

      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are tumor cells detached from the original lesion and getting into the blood and lymphatic circulation systems. They potentially establish new tumors in remote areas, namely, metastasis. Isolation of CTCs and following biological molecular analysis facilitate investigating cancer and coming out treatment. Since CTCs carry important information on the primary tumor, they are vital in exploring the mechanism of cancer, metastasis, and diagnosis. However, CTCs are very difficult to separate due to their extreme heterogeneity and rarity in blood. Recently, advanced technologies, such as nanosurfaces, quantum dots, and Raman spectroscopy, have been integrated with microfluidic chips. These achievements enable the next generation isolation technologies and subsequent biological analysis of CTCs. In this review, we summarize CTCs' separation with microfluidic chips based on the principle of immunomagnetic isolation of CTCs. Fundamental insights, clinical applications, and potential future directions are discussed.

      Molecular modeling techniques play a relevant role in drug design providing detailed information at atomistic level on the structural, dynamical, mechanistic and electronic properties of biological systems involved in diseases' onset, integrating and supporting commonly used experimental approaches. These information are often not accessible to the experimental techniques taken singularly, but are of crucial importance for drug design. Due to the enormous increase of the computer power in the last decades, quantum mechanical (QM) or first-principles-based methods have become often used to address biological issues of pharmaceutical relevance, providing relevant information for drug design. Due to their complexity and their size, biological systems are often investigated by means of a mixed quantum-classical (QM/MM) approach, which treats at an accurate QM level a limited chemically relevant portion of the system and at the molecular mechanics (MM) level the remaining of the biomolecule and its environment. This method provides a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy, allowing to characterize the properties of the biological system and the (free) energy landscape of the process in study with the accuracy of a QM description. In this review, after a brief introduction of QM and QM/MM methods, we will discuss few representative examples, taken from our work, of the application of these methods in the study of metallo-enzymes of pharmaceutical interest, of metal-containing anticancer drugs targeting the DNA as well as of neurodegenerative diseases. The information obtained from these studies may provide the basis for a rationale structure-based drug design of new and more efficient inhibitors or drugs.

For treating NDs, comprehensive and alternative medicines have attracted scientific researchers' attention recently. Edible mushrooms are essential for preventing several age-based neuronal dysfunctions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Mushroom such as Grifola frondosa, Lignosus rhinocerotis, Hericium erinaceus, may improve cognitive functions.

Medicinal mushrooms are being used for novel and natural compounds that help modulate immune responses and possess anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-oxidant properties. Compounds such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polysaccharides, and metal chelating agents are validated in different ND treatments.

      G-quadruplexes have raised considerable interest during the past years for the development of therapies against cancer. These noncanonical structures of DNA may be found in telomeres and/or oncogene promoters, and it has been observed that the stabilization of such G-quadruplexes may disturb tumor cell growth. Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to folding and stabilization of these G-quadruplexes are still not well established, and they are the focus of much current work in this field. In seminal works, stabilization was observed to be produced by cations. However, subsequent studies showed that different kinds of small molecules, from planar and nonplanar organic molecules to square-planar and octahedral metal complexes, may also lead to the stabilization of G-quadruplexes. Thus, the comprehension and rationalization of the interaction of these small molecules with G-quadruplexes are also important topics of current interest in medical applications. To shed light on the questions arising from the literature on the formation of G-quadruplexes, their stabilization, and their interaction with small molecules, synergies between experimental studies and computational works are needed. In this review, we mainly focus on in silico approaches and provide a broad compilation of different leading studies carried out to date by different computational methods. We divide these methods into twomain categories: (a) classical methods, which allow for long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and the corresponding analysis of dynamical information, and (b) quantum methods (semiempirical, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and density functional theory methods), which allow for the explicit simulation of the electronic structure of the system but, in general, are not capable of being used in long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and, therefore, give a more static picture of the relevant processes.
