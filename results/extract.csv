      In this paper, we discuss biological effects of electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds in the context of cancer biology. In particular, we review the nanomechanical properties of microtubules (MTs), the latter being one of the most successful targets for cancer therapy. We propose an investigation on the coupling of electromagnetic radiation to mechanical vibrations of MTs as an important basis for biological and medical applications. In our opinion, optomechanical methods can accurately monitor and control the mechanical properties of isolated MTs in a liquid environment. Consequently, studying nanomechanical properties of MTs may give useful information for future applications to diagnostic and therapeutic technologies involving non-invasive externally applied physical ﬁelds. For example, electromagnetic ﬁelds or high intensity ultrasound can be used therapeutically avoiding harmful side effects of chemotherapeutic agents or classical radiation therapy.

      Nanobiosensors have played a key role as portable devices in the rapid breast cancer diagnosis and in clinical medicine like point-of-care devices. However, understanding biomarkers and nanomaterials is crucial for improving the performance of nanobiosensors for all stages of different diseases or treatment. Therefore, this study not only investigates the effect of biomarkers and nanomaterials such as metallic, carbon structures and quantum dot on the accuracy of nanobiosensors for early detection of breast cancer, but also exhibits how they are used in vivo and in vitro and their application in point-of-care devices for personalized cancer diagnosis. Afterwards, application of fluidics and microchips as point-of-care nanobiosensors in the early detection of biomarkers associated with breast cancer diagnosis was discussed. Furthermore, the integration of nanobiosensors in nanomotors platforms for the treatment of breast cancer was overviewed. Finally, the ongoing challenges and future trends on the detection limit of nanobiosensors, their application in point-of-care clinical diagnostics and the approaches implemented for their improvements by highlighting the successful reports on the revolution of personalized diagnostics were surveyed.

      This paper contains the review of quantum entanglement investigations in living systems, and in the quantum mechanically modelled photoactive prebiotic kernel systems. We define our modelled self-assembled supramolecular photoactive centres, composed of one or more sensitizer molecules, precursors of fatty acids and a number of water molecules, as a photoactive prebiotic kernel systems. We propose that life first emerged in the form of such minimal photoactive prebiotic kernel systems and later in the process of evolution these photoactive prebiotic kernel systems would have produced fatty acids and covered themselves with fatty acid envelopes to become the minimal cells of the Fatty Acid World. Specifically, we model self-assembling of photoactive prebiotic systems with observed quantum entanglement phenomena. We address the idea that quantum entanglement was important in the first stages of origins of life and evolution of the biospheres because simultaneously excite two prebiotic kernels in the system by appearance of two additional quantum entangled excited states, leading to faster growth and self-replication of minimal living cells. The quantum mechanically modelled possibility of synthesizing artificial self-reproducing quantum entangled prebiotic kernel systems and minimal cells also impacts the possibility of the most probable path of emergence of protocells on the Earth or elsewhere. We also examine the quantum entangled logic gates discovered in the modelled systems composed of two prebiotic kernels. Such logic gates may have application in the destruction of cancer cells or becoming building blocks of new forms of artificial cells including magnetically active ones.

      Graphene has distinctive mechanical, electronic, and optical properties, which researchers have applied to develop innovative electronic materials including transparent conductors and ultrafast transistors. Lately, the understanding of various chemical properties of graphene has expedited its application in high-performance devices that generate and store energy. Graphene is now increasing its terrain outside electronic and chemical applications toward biomedical areas such as precise bio sensing through graphene-quenched fluorescence, graphene-enhanced cell differentiation and growth, and graphene-assisted laser desorption/ionization for mass spectrometry. In this Account, we evaluate recent efforts to apply graphene and graphene oxides (GO) to biomedical research and a few different approaches to prepare graphene materials designed for biomedical applications and a brief perspective on their future applications. Because of its outstanding aqueous processability, amphiphilicity, surface functionalizability, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and fluorescence quenching ability, GO chemically exfoliated from oxidized graphite is considered a promising material for biological applications. In addition, the hydrophobicity and flexibility of large-area graphene synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) allow this material to play an important role in cell growth and differentiation. Graphene is considered to be an encouraging and smart candidate for numerous biomedical applications such as NIR-responsive cancer therapy and fluorescence bio-imaging and drug delivery. To that end, suitable preparation and unique approaches to utilize graphene-based materials such as graphene oxides (GOs), reduced graphene oxides (rGOs), and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in biology and medical science are gaining growing interest.

      A novel strategy to precisely detect or monitor various biomaterials in living cells poses paramount importance in understanding cellular processes. Graphene, a newly emerged two-dimensional carbon material, has been widely utilized for biosensors owing to its multifarious characteristics including mechanical, electrical, and optical properties (e.g. stability, conductivity, fluorescence quenching and photoluminescence). In addition, graphene derivatives and their innate characteristics, such as biocompatibility low cytotoxicity and water solubility have facilitated the use of graphene-based materials for live cell biosensing, wherein graphene is utilized as a core material by itself or in combination with other functional nanomaterials to load target-specific probes, fluorescent dyes, and other signaling molecules. Such graphene-based hybrid nanomaterials have been employed to detect various cellular entities in living cells, including ions, biomolecules, genetic molecules, proteins, enzymes, and even whole cells. The following review will discuss a number of previous studies in which graphene-based hybrid constructs were used for live cell biosensing, and their potential applications in cancer research and stem cell therapy.

      With the wide applications of magnetic fields (MFs) in medicine, researchers from different disciplines have gained interest in understanding the effect of various types of MFs on living cells and organisms. In this paper, we mainly focus on the immunological and physical aspects of the immune responses and their mechanisms under different types of MFs. Immune cells were slightly affected by low-frequency alternating MFs but were strongly influenced by moderate-intensity MFs and high-gradient MFs (HGMFs). Larger immune cells, such as macrophages, were more sensitive to HGMFs, which biased the cell polarization into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Subject to the gradient forces of varying directions and strength, the elongated M2 macrophage also remodeled the cytoskeleton with actin polymerization and changed the membrane receptors and ion channel gating. These alterations were very similar to changes caused by the small GTPase RhoA interference in macrophage. Regulation of iron metabolism may also contribute to the MF effects in macrophages. High MFs were found to regulate the iron content in monocyte-/macrophage-derived osteoclasts by affecting the expression of iron-regulation genes. On the other hand, paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) combined with external MFs play an important role in T-cell immunity. Paramagnetic NP-coated T-cells can cluster their T-cell receptors (TCRs) by using an external MF, thus increasing the cell-cell contact and communication followed by enhanced tumor killing capacity. The external MF can also guide the adoptively transferred magnetic NP-coated T-cells to their target sites in vivo, thus dramatically increasing the efficiency of cell therapy. Additionally, iron oxide NPs for ferroptosis-based cancer therapy and other MF-related therapeutic applications with obstacles were also addressed. Furthermore, for a profound understanding of the effect of MFs on immune cells, multidisciplinary research involving both experimental research and theoretical modeling is essential.

      The early diagnosis of diseases, e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and various types of cancer, and monitoring the response of patients to the therapy plays a critical role in clinical treatment; therefore, there is an intensive research for the determination of many clinical analytes. In order to achieve point-of-care sensing in clinical practice, sensitive, selective, cost-effective, simple, reliable, and rapid analytical methods are required. Biosensors have become essential tools in biomarker sensing, in which electrode material and architecture play critical roles in achieving sensitive and stable detection. Carbon nanomaterials in the form of particle/dots, tube/wires, and sheets have recently become indispensable elements of biosensor platforms due to their excellent mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. This review summarizes developments in this lucrative field by presenting major biosensor types and variability of sensor platforms in biomedical applications.

      Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent a common neurological pathology that determines a progressive deterioration of the brain or the nervous system. For treating NDs, comprehensive and alternative medicines have attracted scientific researchers' attention recently. Edible mushrooms are essential for preventing several age-based neuronal dysfunctions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Mushroom such as Grifola frondosa, Lignosus rhinocerotis, Hericium erinaceus, may improve cognitive functions. It has also been reported that edible mushrooms (basidiocarps/mycelia extracts or isolated bioactive compounds) may reduce beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. Medicinal mushrooms are being used for novel and natural compounds that help modulate immune responses and possess anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-oxidant properties. Compounds such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polysaccharides, and metal chelating agents are validated in different ND treatments. This review aims to assess mushrooms' role and their biomolecules utilization for treating different kinds of NDs. The action mechanisms, presented here, including reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and modulation of acetylcholinesterase activity, protecting neurons or stimulation, and regulating neurotrophins synthesis. We also provide background about neurodegenerative diseases and in-silico techniques of the drug research. High costs associated with experiments and current ethical law imply efficient alternatives with limited cost value. In silico approaches provide an alternative method with low cost that has been successfully implemented to cure ND disorders in recent days. We also describe the applications of computational procedures such as molecular docking, virtual high-throughput screening, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, quantum-mechanical methods for drug design. They were reported against various targets in NDs.

      G-quadruplexes have raised considerable interest during the past years for the development of therapies against cancer. These noncanonical structures of DNA may be found in telomeres and/or oncogene promoters, and it has been observed that the stabilization of such G-quadruplexes may disturb tumor cell growth. Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to folding and stabilization of these G-quadruplexes are still not well established, and they are the focus of much current work in this field. In seminal works, stabilization was observed to be produced by cations. However, subsequent studies showed that different kinds of small molecules, from planar and nonplanar organic molecules to square-planar and octahedral metal complexes, may also lead to the stabilization of G-quadruplexes. Thus, the comprehension and rationalization of the interaction of these small molecules with G-quadruplexes are also important topics of current interest in medical applications. To shed light on the questions arising from the literature on the formation of G-quadruplexes, their stabilization, and their interaction with small molecules, synergies between experimental studies and computational works are needed. In this review, we mainly focus on in silico approaches and provide a broad compilation of different leading studies carried out to date by different computational methods. We divide these methods into twomain categories: (a) classical methods, which allow for long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and the corresponding analysis of dynamical information, and (b) quantum methods (semiempirical, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and density functional theory methods), which allow for the explicit simulation of the electronic structure of the system but, in general, are not capable of being used in long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and, therefore, give a more static picture of the relevant processes.
